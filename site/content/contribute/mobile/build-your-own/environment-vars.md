In order to use the **make build**, **make build-android** and/or **make build-ios** commands, you'll need to set a few environment variables. In order to make fastlane work with these environment variables you have two options:

* Copy the file with your variables to `./mattermost-mobile/fastlane/.env` where `.env` is the file name.

or

* Create an .sh file with your variables (for example `my_env.sh`), and execute `source my_env.sh` in the terminal session where you will later execute the **make** commands.
